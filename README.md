_\* Indicates an operating system and release that previously was supported by this script._

## Using the installation scripts

To use the installation scripts, simply run this command as root. The script will ask you whether you would like to install just the panel, just Wings or both.

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OzzieMoods-MD/pterodactyl-Install/refs/heads/main/install.sh)
```
- Token: OzzieGanteng

_Note: On some systems, it's required to be already logged in as root before executing the one-line command (where `sudo` is in front of the command does not work)._

Here is a [Tutorial](https://youtu.be/L2-CLTXNTpg?si=JaCbwCucre28uwQX) that illustrates the installation process.
